## :page_facing_up: Explanation

The project is a website that presents detailed information on a digital menu for any gastronomic establishment. It allows choosing the location through an intuitive search field, where users can select the restaurant of their choice. The website displays complete information about the available dishes, including a detailed description of the ingredients, the price of each item, and the category it belongs to (starters, main dishes, desserts, drinks, etc.).

Furthermore, each dish is accompanied by a high-quality illustrative image, which simulates the real appearance of the food, making it easier for customers to choose. The digital menu also offers the option to filter items by different criteria, such as vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or lactose-free.

The website allows you to view promotions and special offers of the day, as well as highlighting the most popular dishes among customers. So you can click and toggle to see the different offer options available.

## üìÅ Pages

The site has one page, which is:

- **Home:**1. Menu:
The home page of the digital menu presents a complete list of all available dishes, organized by categories such as starters, main dishes, desserts, drinks, among others. Each item is described in detail, including main ingredients, customization options (if any), and price. Each dish is accompanied by a high-quality image that illustrates its actual appearance. Customers can easily browse the different categories using the side menu or through filters, such as vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, among others.

2. Purchase Summary:
After choosing the desired dishes, customers are directed to the purchase summary page. In this section, they can review all selected items, quantities, and total prices. Customers have the option to add or remove items, adjust quantities, and apply any available discounts or promotions. The purchase summary also shows the subtotal, taxes, and final order total.

3. Address:
On the next page, customers enter their delivery information or pickup location. They can fill in their name, address, phone number and additional instructions if needed. This page ensures that the restaurant has all the information necessary to deliver or have the order ready for pickup.

4. Final Purchase Summary:
Finally, the last page is the final purchase summary. Here, customers can review all order details one last time, including the selected dishes, delivery address or pickup location, and the total amount to pay. They have the opportunity to confirm the order before finalizing it, ensuring that all information is correct. 

## ‚öîÔ∏è Challenge

In this challenge, you have to build a website that will show the weather in places around the world! The application must be built using the consumption of an API that will provide the necessary data to display on your website. A very good challenge to learn the whole context of front-end applications using React.
